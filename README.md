### Allergy-Friendly Product Finder Challenge: Iceland Foods Hackathon in four hours
[icelandhackathon](https://icelandhackathon.netlify.app/)
# Introduction
Welcome to my Allergy-Friendly Product Finder challenge for the Iceland Foods Hackathon! We built an app, focused on smoothies with the main functionality of an allergy filter.


# Our Solution
We approached this challenge with an understanding of the importance of inclusive and allergy-aware product recommendations. Here's an overview of how we tackled the challenge:

# Smoothie Card Component: As a key feature, we created a Smoothie Card component that displays relevant information about each recommended product, such as title, allergens, and rating.

Running the App
To experience the Allergy-Friendly Product Finder app firsthand, follow these steps:

React: Used for building the user interface components and managing state.
Supabase: Utilised as the backend database for storing product information.
Jest and Testing Library: Implemented automated tests to ensure the robustness of the app.
Reflection (Please note the testing was implemented the following morning so did not count towards Hackathon)
Participating in this challenge was a fantastic opportunity to combine my coding skills with problem-solving and creativity in a team environment.

I'm happy of the outcome of our efforts, we were able to meet our MVP in just four hours.

Acknowledgments
I'd like to express my gratitude to the Iceland Foods Hackathon organisers for hosting this great challenge.


Happy coding,
